# Capstone_Project_SentimentAnalysis

Customer Sentiment Analysis Feedback is an analytical approach that aims to understand and measure the opinions, attitudes, and feelings of users or customers towards a service, product, or experience. In the digital era, we are connected online and can connect at any time so customers have various ways to provide their feedback, whether through social media, surveys, reviews, or direct interaction with the company. 

Fluctuation in service or product quality is one of the major challenges for companies. It can be caused by various factors, including changes to training materials, or technical issues. 
In the case study of PT MariBelajar Indonesia Cerdas, the approach we propose is through the use of information technology, such as Artificial Intelligence to help improve customer sentiment analysis feedback, by conducting more precise customer segmentation. More sophisticated data analysis can certainly help group customers into more relevant segments based on customer preferences and sentiments.
